CS11 Intro C++ Lab 1 - Questions
================================
 
Q1:  Are you using GNU g++ or LLVM clang++?  Show how you know this by
     running a command on your system and including the output in this file.
 
I'm using GNU g++ on Ubuntu. I know this is installed since I ran the command g ++ --version and received the output:
g++ (Ubuntu 5.4.0-6ubuntu1~16.04.12) 5.4.0 20160609

Q2:  What command do you use to build your submission?
I used this command to build my submission:
 
g++ -std=c++14 -Wall convert.cpp units.cpp -o unit
 
This compiles both convert.cpp and units.cpp (contains UValue class functions and convert_to) and names the program as 'unit'.
